                <p class="center">There are many reasons to weave a regular health checkup into your fitness lifestyle. One of the most important reasons is to prevent any disease. When you go for health checks, the laboratory tests done in the process will help in early detection and treatment of a potential health problem. Health checks vary from person to person, based on their sex, age, family health, and lifestyle. Health checks not only promote better health but also improve a patient-doctor relationship. The doctors can educate the patients about living a healthy life and how they can avoid dangerous habits such as alcoholism, tobacco addiction, binge eating, inactivity etc.</p>

        <h3 class="h-secondary center">MRI Diagnostic</h3>
        <p class="center">Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a medical imaging technique used in radiology to form pictures of the anatomy and the physiological processes of the body. MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields, magnetic field gradients, and radio waves to generate images of the organs in the body. MRI does not involve X-rays or the use of ionizing radiation, which distinguishes it from CT and PET scans. MRI is a medical application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) which can also be used for imaging in other NMR applications, such as NMR spectroscopy.<br/>

            While the hazards of ionizing radiation are now well controlled in most medical contexts,[medical citation needed] an MRI may still be seen as a better choice than a CT scan. MRI is widely used in hospitals and clinics for medical diagnosis and staging and follow-up of disease without exposing the body to radiation. An MRI may yield different information compared with CT. Risks and discomfort may be associated with MRI scans. Compared with CT scans, MRI scans typically take longer and are louder, and they usually need the subject to enter a narrow, confining tube. In addition, people with some medical implants or other non-removable metal inside the body may be unable to undergo an MRI examination safely.</p>

        <h3 class="h-secondary center">X-Ray Diagnostic</h3>
        <p class="center">X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation, similar to visible light. Unlike light, however, x-rays have higher energy and can pass through most objects, including the body. Medical x-rays are used to generate images of tissues and structures inside the body. If x-rays travelling through the body also pass through an x-ray detector on the other side of the patient, an image will be formed that represents the “shadows” formed by the objects inside the body.</p>
